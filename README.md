# Description
In this project, I'm creating a simple blog application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, leveraging Docker for containerization and Postman for API testing. The goal is to build a seamless and efficient blogging experience. By containerizing the application using Docker, I ensure consistent deployment and easy scalability. Postman will enable me to test the API endpoints for different CRUD operations.
